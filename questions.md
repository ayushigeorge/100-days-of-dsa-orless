# Day 1

Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only positive integers, find a continuous sub-array that adds to a given number S and return the left and right index(1-based indexing) of that subarray.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which come first on moving from left to right.

Note:- You have to return an ArrayList consisting of two elements left and right. In case no such subarray exists return an array consisting of element -1.

# Day2
Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
