# Day 1

Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only positive integers, find a continuous sub-array that adds to a given number S and return the left and right index(1-based indexing) of that subarray.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which come first on moving from left to right.

Note:- You have to return an ArrayList consisting of two elements left and right. In case no such subarray exists return an array consisting of element -1.

# Day2
Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4

# Day 3
Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 

 # Day 4
 Given a singly linked list of N nodes.
The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is
1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3.
If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element.
For example, if the linked list given is 1->2->3->4->5->6, then the middle node of the list is 4.

# Day 5
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

# Day 6
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

# Day 7
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending NO.
# Day 8
Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

# Day 9
Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.

# Day 10
Given a singly linked list of N nodes.
The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is
1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3.
If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element.
For example, if the linked list given is 1->2->3->4->5->6, then the middle node of the list is 4.
# Day 11
Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 .
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2   (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)

Note :- If there is no element return -1 as answer while popping.

# Day 11
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.
# Day 12
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.
# Day  13
Given an integer array Arr of size N. For each element in the array, check whether the right adjacent element (on the next immediate position) of the array is smaller. If next element is smaller, update the current index to that element. If not, then  -1.

# Day 14
Complete the function to find spiral order traversal of a tree. For below tree, function should return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
# Day 15
Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 .
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2   (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)

Note :- If there is no element return -1 as answer while popping.
# Day 16
Given a stack, the task is to sort it such that the top of the stack has the greatest element.
# Day 17
Given a string s, remove all its adjacent duplicate characters recursively. 
# Day 18
Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)
# Day 19
Given a string S consisting only of opening and closing parenthesis 'ie '('  and ')', find out the length of the longest valid(well-formed) parentheses substring.
NOTE: Length of the smallest valid substring ( ) is 2.
# Day 20
Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.
# Day 21
Given N activities with their start and finish day given in array start[ ] and end[ ]. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a given day.
Note : Duration of the activity includes both starting and ending day.

# Day 22
You are given N pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number. A pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. You have to find the longest chain which can be formed from the given set of pairs. 
# Day 23
Given a binary tree, find its height.
# Day 24
Given a Binary Tree, return Left view of it. Left view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is visited from Left side. The task is to complete the function leftView(), which accepts root of the tree as argument.
 # Day 25
 Given a Binary Tree of size N, find all the nodes which don't have any sibling. You need to return a list of integers containing all the nodes that don't have a sibling in sorted order.

Note: Root node can not have a sibling so it cannot be included in our answer
